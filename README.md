# NLW Setup | Dates and Web Push API Notifications

![banner](banner.png)

> Application built at the `Rocketseat (Next Level Week | Setup)` event, where we developed a `Habit Tracker` where the user can create an account
> and thus define and manage habits to be carried out on certain days of the week, mark them as completed or not, thus making
> the user habits dashboard or table molds itself over time. For this we deal with the `manipulation of dates and time` in both the frontend and the
> backend. In addition we use the `Push API` which gives web applications the ability to receive notifications sent to them from a server, whether
> the web application in the foreground or not, or even currently loaded, in a user agent. This allows developers to provide
> `asynchronous notifications and updates to opt-in users`, resulting in better engagement with timely new content.
